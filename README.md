Magic-And-Swords
API

About
What is this?
This website provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Magic-And-Swords.  This website is much like having a recipe of building an RPG game with the code and interaction ability.  


What is an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses. 


What are REST APIs?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.  A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of loose conventions based on HTTP verbs, errors, and hyperlinks. 
The main feature of REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.

The API is missing stuff!

We know! Feel free to contribute to open issues on GitHub. You will have the ability to view, edit, add, and delete new Hero's, Armors, Weapons, and Items.  Have some fun.  That is what it is all about.
So who built this?
Magic-And-Swards was thought up and engineered by four amazing and well educated full-stack developers Dante Arceneaux, Scott Cho, Brenda Kinkade, and Tia Smith.  These promising and talented full-stack developers come from all different backgrounds and were put together by chance.  Their learning was very fast paced and intense.  They had many hurdles and struggles to overcome.  All of that did not matter to them because at the end of the day, they were a team no matter what.
The Magic-And-Sword API took a lot of brainstorming and was a collaboration of many ideas put together.  It was a team learning project which helped them all in beginning their careers.
